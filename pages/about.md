My name is Andrea, I am a Chilean midwife and a self-taught watercolor illustrator. My creative journey began 2 years ago, in State College, PA. Here, I started learning  about watercolors because I really needed to change my routine of life. As an expat, I was missing my country, my family and friends, so learning watercolors gave me the possibility to develop my creativity and express myself. During this time, I have developed a big admiration for naturalist illustration, botanical watercolor and illustrative watercolor. They are difficult disciplines, but  I want to continue learning about them and improve my technique.

What is  Naturalist Illustration?
Naturalist illustration is a discipline characterized by exploring themes related to the nature, like life and biodiversity representations.. Those illustrations not only represented the discovered species physiognomy, but also the environment. Naturalist illustration is considered closer to realism or even to hyperrealism than to scientific illustration. This discipline searches for the harmony in compositions and the use of colour.
