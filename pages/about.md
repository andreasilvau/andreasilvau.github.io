My name is Andrea, I am a Chilean midwife and a self-taught watercolor illustrator. My creative journey began 2 years ago, in State College, PA. Here, I started learning  about watercolors because I really needed to change my routine of life. As an expat, I was missing my country, my family and friends, so learning watercolors gave me the possibility to develop my creativity and express myself. During this time, I have developed a big admiration for naturalist illustration, botanical watercolor and illustrative watercolor. They are difficult disciplines, but  I want to continue learning about them and improve my technique.

What is  Naturalist Illustration?
Naturalist illustration is a discipline characterized by exploring themes related to the nature, like life and biodiversity representations. Those illustrations not only represented the discovered species physiognomy, but also the environment.
