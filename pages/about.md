My name is Andrea, I am a Chilean midwife and a self-taught illustrator. My creative journey began 2 years ago, in State College, PA. Here, I started learning  about watercolors because I really needed to change my routine of life. As an expat, I was missing my country, my family and friends, so learning watercolors gave me the possibility to develop my creativity and express myself.
