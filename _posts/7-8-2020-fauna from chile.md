Megaptera novaeangliae
Other Common names: Jorobada Humpback; Jibarte; Yubarta.
The humpback has a distinctive body shape, with long pectoral fins and a knobbly head. It is known for breaching and other distinctive surface behaviors, making it popular with whale watchers. Males produce a complex song lasting 10 to 20 minutes, which they repeat for hours at a time. All the males in a group will produce the same song, which is different each season. Its purpose is not clear, though it may help induce estrus in females. Found in oceans and seas around the world, humpback whales typically migrate up to 25,000 km (16,000 mi) each year. They feed in polar waters, and migrate to tropical or subtropical waters to breed and give birth, fasting and living off their fat reserves. Their diet consists mostly of krill and small fish. Humpbacks have a diverse repertoire of feeding methods, including the bubble net technique.  In spring, it travels to its feeding areas at high latitudes, and in winter it travels to tropical waters to reproduce. In Chile, the Estrecho de Magallanes and the Chilean Patagonian  have been registered as a feeding area for the humpback whale in the summer months.
