Megaptera novaeangliae
Other Common names: Jorobada Humpback; Jibarte; Yubarta.
The humpback has a distinctive body shape, with long pectoral fins and a knobbly head. Found in oceans and seas around the world, humpback whales typically migrate up to 25,000 km (16,000 mi) each year. They feed in polar waters, and migrate to tropical or subtropical waters to breed and give birth, fasting and living off their fat reserves. Their diet consists mostly of krill and small fish.   In spring, it travels to its feeding areas at high latitudes, and in winter it travels to tropical waters to reproduce. In Chile, the Estrecho de Magallanes and the Chilean Patagonian have been registered as a feeding area for the humpback whale in the summer months.
