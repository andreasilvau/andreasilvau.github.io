The Chucao,  the king of the forests, is a small bird with an artistic and loud reputation typical of the rainforests of southern Chile. However, normally it lives very hidden and is therefore difficult to observe.... It is really difficult to find an inspiration when your mind and heart are in a different place. However, this little cutie showed up and today I finally had some time to finish it.

Pingüino de Magallanes or (Spheniscus magellanicus) is a South American penguin, breeding in coastal Patagonia, including Argentina, Chile and the Falkland Islands, with some migrating to Brazil where they are occasionally seen as far north as Espirito Santo. Its nearest relatives are the African penguin, the Humboldt penguin, and the Galápagos penguins. often seen in inshore waters and from ferries. Breeds around coasts of southern Chile, Argentina, and in the Falklands; nests in colonies in underground burrows. Only identification concern is limited range overlap in central Chile with Humboldt Penguin, which has single (not double) black breast band, narrower white eyebrow, and big pink patch at base of bill.
