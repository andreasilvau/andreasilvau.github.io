This is the repository of my personal website [andreasilvau.com](https://andreasilvau.com)
The theme is based on [Millennial by LeNPaul](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Millennial)

## Issues when forking Millennial theme
The page was not building, I had to include a master branch to the repo
```bash
git checkout -b master
git add -A
git commit -m "correction to include a master branch"
git push --set-upstream origin master
```
